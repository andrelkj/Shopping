# Pytest 

Pytest is a useful tool to run test scripts with python

## How to define test files and test cases?

Pytest standard logic is to look for any file that starts with "test" and those are considered as test files. The same conversion also works to define test cases, meaning that any defined function starting with the "test" statement will be considered as one test case.

## Methods
- assert - validation method that checks if the statement is true and throw an exception in case it is not, causing the test to fail
